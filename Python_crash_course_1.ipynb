        "2. **Text and Data Mining fundamentals:** This section uses a full text research output extracted from [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) and demonstrates some basic text mining practices, such as sentence segmentation, tokenization, parts of speech tagging, named entity recognition and stemming. We also give some exercises to you to practice. \n",
        "3. **Examples using the CORE API:** This is a more advanced section. Some may feel that it requires some technical skills, while others will find it challenging and would want to try the final practical exercise. The section uses the [CORE API](https://core.ac.uk/services#api) and demonstrates how to create word clouds from the University of Cambridge publications deposited in the institutional repository, Apollo.

Our examples require a combination of text and code and that is the main reason that we used Python Notebooks when creating this guide.\n",

        "If you were reading any other page, a blog post, a MS word document, a webpage, you would probably use the cursor to scroll down and up the page. Python Notebooks are a bit different. They have an order and their capabilities are better highlighted when the \"Play\" button is used. The \"Play\" button is located on the left hand side of the code field and you should click on it each time you want to move to the next section. The \"Play\" button not only helps you move from one section to another, but it also distinguishes the executable code from the plain text and executes it. If this is your first experience with Python Notebooks the touch and feel may look odd to you, but you will soon get used to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next block is a cell with code in it. Whenever you meet a similar block you need to click on the \"Play\" button to run the code. As you go over this guide, you will see many blocks with code; you must run them by pushing the \"Play\" button and you must do that in the order that the code blocks appear. If you fail to run a code block, there are high chances that the next block code will not run properly and you will receive an error message.\n",
